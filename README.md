# convenient-classic-carspawner
This is a Github page for the Convenient Classic Carspawner [CCC], a utility for Garry's Mod Trainbuild written in the esoteric scripting language Expression 2 that assembles, details, and aligns randomized consists of freight cars. This system is the gold standard for carspawning technologies, and is continually updated with new features and regular bugfixes.

Using a matrix of "tags" built into the information tables within the chip, you can specify an extremely large variety of potential train types. Use a simple single-line text command to summon whatever consist you desire, with as much or little specificity as required. You can use multiple commands in series to create multiple segments of differing types, or use the built-in Datasignal capabilities to control the system remotely. Information on all of the functional components within the chip can be explored with the ingame tutorial and information system.
