# convenient-classic-carspawner
This is a Github page for the Convenient Classic Carspawner, a utility for Garry's Mod Trainbuild that makes pre-built train cars. This is (hopefully) the end-all be-all of carspawners, with high flexibility, modularity, efficency, and intuitive usage.


Here's how to download:

1: Locate the latest-version folder here on the Github. 	

2: Go into the folder, and select the latest version "convenient_classic_carspawner_Vx.xx.txt by clicking on it.

3: Select the RAW option on the right. This will take you to a blank page with the script on it.

4: Right-click and select "Save As". Save the file to your downloads as the default name.

4: Move that text file to steam directory/common/garrysmod/garrysmod/data/expression2.

5: Click "Refresh" on the E2 tool sidebar interface in Garry's Mod.	

6: Find the file by searching "carspawner" or some other keyword from the file name.	

7: Double click on the file to open it, then click the X at the top-right to close the window.	

8: Left-click on the ground with the E2 tool, and align the chip with the rails you wish to spawn on.	

9: Done! Follow the ingame tutorial after you've placed the chip for usage and how-to's.
