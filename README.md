# convenient-classic-carspawner
This is the Github page for the Convenient Classic Carspawner project, a utility for Garry's Mod Trainbuild that makes pre-built train cars.
This is (hopefully) the end-all be-all of carspawners, with high flexibility, modularity, efficency, and intuitive usage.

Here's how to download:
1: Locate the latest-version folder here on the Github. 
2: Go into the folder, and select the green option "Clone or Download".
3: Download the convenient_classic_carspawner_vX.XX.txt file on to your computer.
4: Move that text file to steam directory/common/garrysmod/garrysmod/data/expression2.
5: Click "Refresh" on the E2 tool sidebar interface in Garry's Mod.
6: Find the file by searching "carspawner" or some other keyword from the file name.
7: Double click on the file to open it, then click the X at the top-right to close the window.
8: Left-click on the ground with the E2 tool, and align the chip with the rails you wish to spawn on.
9: Done! Follow the ingame tutorial after you've placed the chip for usage and how-to's.
