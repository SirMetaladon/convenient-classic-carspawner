If you're seeing this from the Github page, here's some instructions on how to install the E2:

1: Select the RAW option on the right. This will take you to a blank page with the script on it.

2: Right-click the screen and select "Save As". Save the file to your downloads as the default name.

3: Move that text file to steam directory/common/garrysmod/garrysmod/data/expression2.

4: Click "Refresh" on the E2 tool sidebar interface in Garry's Mod.

5: Find the file by searching "carspawner" or some other keyword from the file name.

6: Double click on the file to open it, then click the X at the top-right to close the window.

7: Left-click on the ground with the E2 tool, and align the chip with the rails you wish to spawn on.

8: Done! Follow the ingame tutorial after you've placed the chip for usage and how-to's.

#Instructions on how to change to RSG/PHX:

#Change the carspawner's model to "models/magtrains/trucks/barber_s2_phx.mdl" or "models/magtrains/trucks/barber_s2_rsg.mdl" to use PHX or RSG respectivley.

Welcome to the Convenient, Classic Carspawner! This E2 is the next generation in car spawning technologies, allowing the user to spawn many styles of train, pre-detailed, and in an intuitive manner.

Type ".help" in chat for a guide on how to use the E2. It will show you through all you need to know on running this E2.


Not much of a description here, if you want more, bug me on Discord or Steam.
